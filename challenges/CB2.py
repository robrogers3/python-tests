class Puzzle:
    """
    Class to represent a peg board puzzle, like the triangle peg puzzles
    at Cracker Barrel.

    The board attribute stores the current state of the board such that
    a tuple (x, y) representing a position on the board can be accessed
    at board[y][x]. All position tuples are shown in the diagram below:

    0,4
    0,3  1,3
    0,2  1,2  2,2
    0,1  1,1  2,1  3,1
    0,0  1,0  2,0  3,0  4,0

    As such, (0, 0), (0, 4), and (4, 0) are the three corners of the
    triangle. Captures can happen in six directions:

    1. (x, y) to (x+2, y), removing (x+1, y)
    2. (x, y) to (x-2, y), removing (x-1, y)
    3. (x, y) to (x, y+2), removing (x, y+1)
    4. (x, y) to (x, y-2), removing (x, y-1)
    5. (x, y) to (x+2, y-2), removing (x+1, y-1)
    6. (x, y) to (x-2, y+2), removing (x-1, y+1)
